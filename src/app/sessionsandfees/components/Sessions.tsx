              I use modern QCH approaches in combination with CBT, positive psychology, and NLP all to create your own personal bespoke treatment plan. 
            </p>
            <p className="pb-5">
            In your first session, we'll explore what brought you to therapy and decide the most appropriate ways to help you progress.
            
             We will use it to build your problem state, in doing this we also build your solution state. We'll look at how your thoughts affect your emotions and experience. 
            </p>
            <p className="pb-5">
              Regarding how many sessions you'll require, everyone is different and I approach each client as a clean slate. 
            </p>
            <p className="pb-5">
              I can say that most therapies require long-term solutions, but that's not the case here. I aim to teach each client how to begin treating themselves, and the sessions can continue until you feel the necessary changes have come to take place.
