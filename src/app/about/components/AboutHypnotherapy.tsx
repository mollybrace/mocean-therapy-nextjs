            <p>In each session I ask myself two key questions, what&#39;s that about? And how can I use it? What this leads to is a way of working that is completely tailored to the client&#39;s way of thinking. Working with clients struggling with anxiety, depression, addiction, or stress. Cognitive Hypnotherapy is built on the principle of working within the client&#39;s model of the world. Therefore, I do not strictly work towards these &#39;labels&#39;. Instead, I approach each session with unconditional positive regard, and respect and hold space for each client so they feel comfortable and heard. </p>

            Some people see the word <i>hypnotherapy</i> and are still determining what will be involved. Will I wave a pocket watch in front of you and make you burst into bouts of spontaneous chicken
            impressions? The answer is <strong>no</strong>.

            Trances are an everyday occurrence. Traditionally people talk about being put into hypnosis as if it&#39;s a special state, but we go in and out of trance all of the time. Trance is part of the thing you want to change. Stressed by something that shouldn&#39;t bother you? You&#39;re in a trance. We&#39;ll work to de-hypnotise you and put you back in control of your emotions.

            All behaviour has a positive purpose. Negative behaviours are just actions the unconscious does for reasons it thinks are bringing you benefits. Our brain is tuned to learn from our experiences, to guide us towards behaviours it&#39;s learnt are rewarding or away from things that could harm us. The trouble is it can make mistakes in its understanding of good from bad.

            <p>Everyone is unique. Most therapies attach a label to guide their choice of treatment. I believe that everyone has arrived at their issue through a series of experiences that have uniquely shaped their minds. In addition to this, I utilise Wordweaving which is my way of using the client&#39;s own words to create suggestions that are intended to accelerate the rate of your improvement and make it permanent. The effect is to help you learn how to stay in control of situations where you didn&#39;t used to be and once you&#39;ve learned you can be in control of that you begin to realise you can control anything about your life that you choose.
