            <p>I primarily work with clients struggling with anxiety, depression, addiction, or stress. Cognitive
            Hypnotherapy is built on the principle of working within the client&apos;s model of the world. Therefore, I
            do not strictly work towards these &apos;labels&apos;. Instead, I approach each session with unconditional
            positive regard and respect and hold space for each client so they feel comfortable and heard. Then,
            together, we build their problem state to help create their solution state.</p>

        <h2 className='text-xl font-bold py-5'>What is hypnotherapy?</h2>
            <p className='pb-5'>
            Some people see the word <i>hypnotherapy</i> and are still determining what will be involved. Will I
            wave a pocket watch in front of you and make you burst into bouts of spontaneous chicken
            impressions? The answer is <strong>no</strong>. 
            </p>
            <p>
            You will always be in control. Any protective behaviour is a trance state; triggered by our autonomic nervous system. We all go in and out of trance naturally - you have probably noticed times in your day when you are &#39;in a trance&#39;. For example, can you remember
            brushing your teeth this morning? This is a trance state when we are triggered into protection, for example, anxiety.

            As a QCH Therapist, I help your nervous system understand that you are safe and promote growth.
